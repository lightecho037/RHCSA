Exercise: 1
Working with systemd and targets

1 . - Install the httpd package.

  -]$ sudo yum install httpd -y

2 . - View all active targets on the system.

  -]$ systemctl list-units --type=target

3 . - View all targets installed on the disk.

  -]$ systemctl list-units --type target --all

4 . - Display the current default target.

  -]$ systemctl get-default

5. - Change the default target to the multi-user target if the multi-user target is available.

  -]# systemctl set-default multi-user.target

6 . - View all available systemd configuration units.

  -]$ systemctl -t help

 7 . - Find the status of the sshd service.

  -]$ systemctl status httpd.service

8 . - List all active service unit configuration files.

  -]$ systemctl --type=service

9 . - Determine if the httpd service is active.

  -]$ systemctl is-active httpd 

10 . - Determine if the httpd service is enabled, and, if it is not, enable it.

  -]$ systemctl is-enabled httpd

11 . - View enabled and disabled settings for all units of the type "service".

  -]$ systectl list-unit-files --type=service --all

12 . - List all service unit configuration files, whether they are active or not.
 
  -]$ systemctl list-units --all
  
  -]$ systemctl list-units --type=service --all

==================================================================
PGREP, PKILL, KILL AND JOBS

1. As the root user, create a job running in the background of your current terminal. Execute the following script for that program process to be created:

  -]$ (while true; do echo "My program" > ~/output.file; done) &
  
2. View the current jobs running in the background of your terminal.

  -]$ jobs -l  

3. Stop the process from running, without killing the process, using the kill command.

  -]$ kill -19 1449 
  ||or||
  -]$ kill -SIGSTOP %1 (%1 is the job number, if the job was 2 it would be %2)

4. View the stopped jobs in the background.

   -]$ jobs -l

5. Start the process again using the kill command.

  -]$ kill -18 1449
  ||or||
  -]$ kill -SIGCONT %1
  
6. Kill the process without allowing any blocking of the kill command.
  
  -]$ kill -9 1449 

======================================================================
TEST 2 
1. Download and install the httpd service.

-]$ sudo yum install httpd

2. Start the httpd service (or ensure that it is running).

-]$ systemctl start httpd.service

3. As the root user, grep for all processes that are running as the root user and display the process names.

  -]$ pgrep -u root -l

4. As the user user, start the vi program at the terminal.

  -]$ vi

5. As the root user, in your second terminal window, grep for all processes running under the user "user" and include the process names.

  -]$ pgrep -u user -l

6. As the root user, grep for the "httpd" process.

 -]$ pgrep httpd

7. As the root user, kill all of the "user" user's processes and boot that user from the system.

  -]$ pgrep -u user
  -]$ pkill -u user ssh

=========================================================
NICE, RECINE AND PS

1 . - Ensure that you have the httpd package installed on the system.

  -]$ yum info httpd 

2 . - Ensure the httpd service is not running.

  -]$ systemctp stutus httpd 

3 . - Start the httpd service with the most favorable nice possible.

  -]$ nice -n -20 httpd 

4 . - View the current nice of the httpd service using the ps command and grep command together.

  -]$ ps axo pid,comm,nice | grep  httpd

5 . - Renice all httpd processes and set the nice level to 0.
  
  -]$ renice -n 0 $(pgrep httpd)

=========================================================
MONITORING AND CALCULATING CPU LOAD AVERAGES

1 . - View the system uptime and load average.

  -]$ uptime

2 . - View the system uptime and load average in such a way that it also shows what users are logged in
to the system and what the user is doing.

  -]$ w

3 . - Using the proc file system and wc, display the number of processors your system has. 
This is important to calculate the load average of the system.

  -]$ lscpu
  || or ||
  -]$ cat /proc/cpuinfo 

4 . - Calculate the 1, 5, and 15 minute CPU load averages for the system

  -]$ uptime
 09:42:20 up 16:21,  3 users,  load average: 1.04, 0.72, 0.35

Per CPU load average calculation formula: load average / # of cpu
Per CPU load average calculation 1 Minute load average: 1.04 / 2 = 52%
Per CPU load average calculation 5 Minute load average: .72 / 2 = 36%
Per CPU load average calculation 15 Minute load average: .35 / 2 = 17.5%
